                Hello and welcome! I'm a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer with a diverse background that spans across industries and continents. 
                During my time working professionally as a developer, I have honed my skills working on a wide range of projects using the MERN stack, 
                tackling everything from reporting and data analysis to customizable UI frameworks. I thrive in collaborative environments, and prefer 
                to work in a culture that values teamwork over competition. Beyond coding, my journey as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand allowed me to contribute 
                to community development initiatives, reflecting my commitment to social justice. With a knack for clean design, usability, and a passion for 
                pushing boundaries, I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to innovative projects that make a meaningful impact. 
                Let's build something extraordinary together!
